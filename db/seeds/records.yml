    title: Ancient EP
    description: |-
                 Hailing from Czech Republic, we bring you our next compilation full of young and upcoming producers.
                 This compilation contains 5 tracks mostly about 175 BPM, "Way of the Underground" by Dubtrax will take you on a deep space journey and then "8Bit Heart" by Kutlo will smash you with its neuro bass and heavy kicks. "Greed" by Meph brings you the best of hard and punchy neuro basslines and you can expect the same from "The Reason" by Psychical Research. Last but not least, "It's Not Real" shows you how deep can sound even go, albeit with a genre twist.

                 Released on the 1st Bass Drop Anniversary.

                 Jordan Richards-Holmes Aka Monk is one of the young talents who is attacking our label with some serious riddim dubstep.
                 Together with Liam Laverick Aka L3MMY DUBZ - A 16 Years old blood from Middlesbroug - are making their first steps on BASS DROP RECORDS with this joint release.

                 Starting off with the solid opening of the gangster synth heavy track "Animal" and keeping pace with "Hazard Suit", "Impress me" and "Mad Dogs" - this EP is chock full of ethereal yet ripping sounds which make Monk & L3MMY two names you should keep your eye on.

                 Heavy on bass. Heavy on melodies. All playing well together. A feat not many producers are able to pull off.

The exclusive BASS DROP RECORDS release A Fire shows just that. So turn the volume up and let the party begin.

    title: Lizards / Unleash the Hounds
    description: |-
                 Lizards and Unleash the Hounds are the newest releases on BDR, this time from the mighty talented swiss/german duo QBIG & Zenith B

                 Each of the tracks speaks for itself. While Lizards is right there along with the sick deep neuro dnb bangers, Unleash the Hounds with its Drumstep elements and broken rhythm explores the more experimental side of QBIG's and Zenith B's production yet remains heavy hitting on the dance floor.

                 Enjoy both of these tracks absolutely free of charge in lovely 320kbps.
